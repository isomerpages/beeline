#### **I received an SMS and email that Beeline will be ceased. Is this true?**
Yes, Beeline service will cease operation on 1 Jan 2020. Commuters can continue to book a ride on Beeline until the last day of service on 31 Dec 2019.
 
#### **Why is Beeline discontinuing?**

Although Beeline has successfully served a number of Singaporean commuters, after four years the team has decided to cease operations. This decision will allow us to optimise our efforts and resources on developing products and services that can deliver benefits and convenience to more citizens. 

Fortunately, we have open-sourced Beeline, so that others might take advantage of our codebase, building on it to create applications and platforms to help improve first-and-last mile connectivity in Singapore’s transport system. You may read more about it [here](https://blog.data.gov.sg/open-sourcing-beeline-8da9cfde9936). 

#### **Will I be able to book a ride until the end date?**
Yes, commuters can continue to book a ride on Beeline until the last day of service on 31 Dec 2019. Thereafter, the Beeline app consumer services will no longer be in operation.
